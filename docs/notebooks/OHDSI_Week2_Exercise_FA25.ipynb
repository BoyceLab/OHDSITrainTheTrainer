        "Athena is an automated system created by OHDSI for creating and maintaining standard vocabularies.  Standard vocabularies are used in health care data for essentially all non-trivial concepts including patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, lab requests and results, etc.  Standard vocabularies also manage the complexity of the relationships between these concepts including things like hierarchies and classifications of diagnoses and disorders and the relationships between dispensable drug products, ingredients, dose, and dose form.  By using standard vocabularies we can be very specific and very precise in the language we use to define and communicate our ideas.  Standard terminologies will play a central role in virtual everything we study in this course.  Athena is the primary tool we will be using to manage and explore standard terminologies.  \n",

We will find and examine: the types of DM, drugs used to treat type 2 DM, tests associated with Diabetes Mellitus, other conditions related to this concept (such as retinopathy).  This will give us a good start at understanding the types of concepts associated with a condition such as DM as well as an understanding of Athena and how it can be used to define and gain an understanding of how these concepts are related.  \n",

This task is often more complicated that it might first appear as health care data sets are almost always just a small fraction of the data available for the patients they include.  For example, data from an EMR system might have information about medications prescribed for DM for a given patient but the patient was diagnosed outside of the system so there is no record of a diagnosis of DM for this individual.
