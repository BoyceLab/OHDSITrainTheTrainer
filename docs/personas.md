# Personas & Learning Paths

This Train-the-Trainer curriculum is designed to support multiple learner roles within OHDSI.  
Each persona has aligned goals, focus areas, and suggested side exercises for the **six-week program**.

!!! note
    For background on learner personas in **OHDSI** and **Real-World Evidence** education, see the [**STARDUSTT approach**](https://alstdi.github.io/ALS-RWE/stardustt-approach/).

## Vocabulary / Terminology Experts

**Goal:**  
Strengthen understanding of OMOP standardized vocabularies and mapping workflows; teach others how to interpret concepts and relationships.

**Focus Weeks:**  
- **Week 1:** OMOP CDM and Athena Vocabulary Exploration  
- **Week 2:** Concept Set Development in Atlas  
- **Week 3:** Cohort Characterization (vocabulary influence on cohorts)

**Core Tools:**  
Athena · Usagi · Atlas Concept Sets

**Side Exercise:**  
- Identify standard vs non-standard concepts in Athena.  
- Create a small Atlas concept set using preferred vs source vocabularies.  
- Document mapping and descendant logic for discussion.

## Clinicians / Clinical Researchers

**Goal:**  
Use Atlas for rapid cohort discovery and interpretation; connect clinical reasoning to standardized data.

**Focus Weeks:**  
- **Week 1:** Understanding OMOP Domains & Vocabulary Concepts  
- **Week 3:** Building and Characterizing Cohorts  
- **Week 4:** Reviewing Extracted Data Summaries

**Core Tools:**  
Athena (concept interpretation) · Atlas Cohort Editor · Characterization reports

**Side Exercise:**  
- Define an inclusion/exclusion logic for a simple condition cohort.  
- Interpret key demographic and measurement characterizations.  
- Discuss how vocabulary precision influences clinical plausibility.

## Trainers / Facilitators (Meta-Persona)

**Goal:**  
Integrate technical and clinical perspectives; lead sessions effectively across personas.

**Focus Weeks:**  
All weeks (serve as facilitators and reviewers)

**Core Competencies:**  
Adult learning principles · GitHub workflow for shared materials · Discussion facilitation

**Side Exercise:**  
- Lead a short demo on a week’s topic (e.g., vocabulary search or cohort review).  
- Collect and summarize participant reflections.  
- Update the training repository with lesson feedback and improvements.
