# 📚 Syllabus — OHDSI Train-the-Trainer (6-Week Core + Optional Modules)

This master syllabus outlines the **required readings, tools, and assignments** for the six-week OHDSI Train-the-Trainer program, along with **optional advanced modules** for continued professional development.  
The program bridges Epic Clarity experience with OMOP/OHDSI skills through both GUI-based (Atlas, Athena) and SQL-based (Databricks, DBeaver) learning.
